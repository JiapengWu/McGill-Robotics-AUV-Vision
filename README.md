# Vision

This is the lane tracking branch of McGill AUV ROS package implemented for sake of navigating the control system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The .cpp file imports OpenCV library algorithms including Canny Edge Detection, Hough Line Detection, Filter functions and self-implemented Image-to-binary-image function, which performs reliably in lane detection, geometric calculation and localizating.
